How to use:

1. Extract the .zip
2. Get your photo and rename it exactly as personal-image.jpg
3. Change the extension of index.html to .txt or you can directly edit the file if in pc/supprted app in android. Then edit your name, PRN, like fields. Save the html. 
4. Your html file will now correctly preview in your own browser, as localhost. To host it , use any free hosting service like github pages. 
5. Once hosted, copy link. Then google search for link to qr, and convert the link to qr and you can now print and stick the QR. 

Notes:
1. If you use GitHub, you can always make changes to the website by editing the html, even after hosted. Your QR NEED NOT to be changed. 
2. You can also download video that i have uploaded on YouTube, and upload them yourself, and embed that link - so it appears as your channel name there.
3. Right now, both videos are same. When first video is created, its link will be shared and you can update it.
